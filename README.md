# 🔥 Firewall Assistant for Windows

A smart, friendly GUI for controlling which apps can access the internet powered by the built-in Windows Firewall. Instead of dealing with ports, protocols, and cryptic firewall rules, Firewall Assistant gives you:

🚦 Per-app Allow / Block controls

📡 Profiles for Normal / Public Wi-Fi / Focus modes

🤔 “Why is this app not working?” explanations

⏳ 1-hour Temporary Allow

🔐 All powered by the official Windows Firewall (netsh)

> ⚠️ Important: This tool modifies Windows Firewall rules and must be run as Administrator.

## ✨ Features
- Per-Application Control
- Shows apps (name + full path) with recent network activity.
- Mark any app as Allowed or Blocked for the current profile.
- All rules are enforced using Windows Firewall (netsh advfirewall firewall).

## 📂 Profiles

- Switch between three simple profiles — each with its own rules:
- Normal — everyday usage
- Public Wi-Fi — stricter for untrusted networks
- Focus — blocks distracting apps
- One-click switching instantly reapplies firewall rules.

## ❓ “Why is this app not working?”

For any selected app, get clear diagnostics:

- Which profile is active
- Whether the app is effectively Allowed or Blocked
- Whether the rule is explicit or inherited from profile defaults
- If a Temporary Allow is active and when it expires

## ⏱ Temporary Allow (1 Hour)

Give a blocked app 60 minutes of temporary internet access without altering permanent rules.

## 📝 Activity Log

- Logs all profile changes, rule updates, and errors into logs/activity.log.
- Recent entries are shown directly in the UI.
